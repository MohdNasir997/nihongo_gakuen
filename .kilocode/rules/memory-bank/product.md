# Product: Nihongo Learn

## Why This Project Exists

Nihongo Learn is a comprehensive Japanese language learning platform designed to bridge the gap between traditional language education and modern, interactive digital learning. The platform addresses the common challenges faced by Japanese learners:

1. **Accessibility**: Traditional Japanese courses are often expensive, location-bound, and inflexible. Nihongo Learn provides accessible, self-paced learning available anywhere, anytime.

2. **Engagement**: Many language learning apps lack depth and cultural context. Nihongo Learn combines video courses, interactive lessons, and community features to create an engaging learning experience.

3. **Progress Tracking**: Learners struggle to measure their progress and identify gaps. The platform provides detailed progress tracking, JLPT-aligned curriculum, and clear milestones.

4. **Language Exchange**: Finding native Japanese speakers for practice is difficult. The platform's language exchange feature connects learners with native speakers for authentic conversation practice.

## Problems It Solves
